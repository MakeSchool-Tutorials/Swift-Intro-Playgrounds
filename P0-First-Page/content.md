Before we dive into using Xcode, Swift and Apple's Frameworks to build apps, you should take some time to learn the Swift programming language.

We have created multiple playgrounds that each introduce you to an aspect of the Swift programming language:

1. `var` vs. `let`
2. Type inference
3. Strings
4. Optionals
5. Arrays
6. Dictionaries
7. Control flow
8. Functions
9. Classes and structs
10. Initializers
